            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control answers the problem many developers face, which is how to allow multiple individuals to work on the same project without conflict. Each project is stored on a shared remote repository that developers can access using their own local systems. They do this like a library, in that files are checked out and edited before committing them back. Version control systems keep this method of filesharing from doing harm by automatically documenting who changed what and when said changes occurred. It can also merge changes into the same file. This solves any inherent issues with working on the same projects as others.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The advantages of a Version Control System are fairly obvious. Using one, it is impossible to overwrite files. There is a common, easy to access file repository that holds all recent files. People can work on the same files at the same time, minimizing the difficulty inherent to working on a project together. If needed, you can revert back to an older verion of a file or project. Even individuals have the advantage of having their files backed up to a non-local source for extra redundancy. Such a system holds enough advantages that it has become the industry standard when working on projects, especially if said projects involve others.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Basic Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is fairly simple to use. The main difference between Git and other VCS is its method of storing data. Instead of storing information as a list of files and recording the changes to each file over time, Git thinks of data as snapshots on a miniature filesystem. This allows for more flexability when working with Git as opposed to more simple VCSs. The basic process of using Git is to initialize a repository or pull from an existing repository using the pull or init commands. You can then use the add command to add all files that you changes since the last back up. Then you commit the changes to the repository using the commit command before using push to put the files back into the remote repository.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Advantages</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a free open source VCS that is easy to lean and quick to use. It has features like multiple workflows, cheap local branching, and convenient staging areas. All work done on projects using Git is done locally, so you don't need direct access to the remote repository unless you are pushing or pulling files. Every user has a locally stored complete copy of the repository data in addition to it being stored on a seperate server. There is no single point of failure in the system, which allows it to work better than many competing VCSs. It runs much faster than its competitprs, will prevent unintentional overwrites of files on the shared repository.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Short History of Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The foundation of Git was laid with the Linux kernel maintenance(1991-2002). During this time any changes to the software were done using ppatches and archived files. In 2002, the Linus kernal project began using Bitkeeper, a proprietary DVCS. A few years later in 2005, the relationship between the two broke down, and the tool was no longer free-of-charge. The Linux development community responded to this by developing their own tool to replace the Linux kernel. This tool was made with speed, simplicity, and strong support for non-lienar development. This tool eventually evolved into Git, which is obviously still popular today. </p>
